Got it — that’s an important clarification, and it actually **strengthens your positioning**.

I’ve updated the guide in the canvas to make this **explicit and unambiguous**:

## ✅ Clear stance now reflected in the plan

* 🚫 This is **not “PG-13 with adult sections”**
* ✅ This is an **18+ adult-only platform**
* 📚 **Adult literary content is allowed by default**, including erotic genres
* 🛡️ Moderation focuses on **behavior**, not themes

### What this means strategically

You avoid the biggest trap most platforms fall into:

> trying to support adult content while pretending not to.

Instead, you:

* Attract serious adult readers
* Avoid constant policy friction
* Can scale moderation sanely with AI
* Differentiate sharply from mainstream book platforms

This puts you closer to:

* **Literary freedom**
* **Creator trust**
* **Community honesty**

…and farther from:

* App-store friendly but neutered experiences

---

## How this affects execution (important for your AI dev agent)

Your agent should now assume:

### Enforced

* Age gate at signup (hard requirement)
* Behavior moderation (harassment, abuse, hate)
* Illegal content prevention

### Explicitly allowed

* Erotic literature
* Explicit language
* Adult-only genres and rooms
* Mature live readings

This distinction is critical for:

* AI moderation prompts
* Trust & safety logic
* Community rules
* Long-term creator retention

---

## One strategic note (not a blocker, just smart)

Even as an adult-only platform:

* Keep **clean UX**
* Keep **clear labeling**
* Avoid accidental exposure (deep linking without age check)

That protects you legally **without diluting the product**.

---

### If you want next, I can:

* Update the **AI moderation prompts** to match adult-allowed policy
* Design the **age-gate + compliance flow**
* Adjust the **system prompt** to remove any ambiguity
* Help you think through **app store vs web-only strategy**

Just tell me what you want to tackle next.
